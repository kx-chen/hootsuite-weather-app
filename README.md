# Hootsuite Weather App

> Get weather results right in your Hootsuite dashboard!


TODO: 
- [ ] Change class names in HTML from `hs_*`
- [ ] Remove repetition in tests, especially with the dummy data and dummy response JSON
- [ ] Remove inline HTML
- [ ] Refactor return types of responses/geocode results to proper objects
- [ ] Add eventlisteners instead of using `onclick` in HTML
- [ ] Extract all error messages, class selectors, strings, urls into own file


Possible improvements: 
- Comparison with already existing WeatherModels when adding new locations so 
all locations don't have to refresh when adding a new location
